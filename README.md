 Cryptocurrency or Crypto, as they call it, is digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment created using encryption algorithms. This digital money doesn't require a bank or financial institution to verify transactions and can be used for purchases or as an investment. Transactions are then verified and recorded on a blockchain, an unchangeable ledger that tracks and records assets and trades.Cryptocurrency is digital money that doesn't require a bank or financial institution to verify transactions and can be used for purchases or as an investment.

### **-How the idea of Coinbase came about**

Coinbase started as a platform for simply buying, selling and storing bitcoins via bank transfers, but with the range of available cryptocurrencies gradually expanding, including Ethereum, Litecoin and many others, over time Coinbase has evolved into a multifunctional cryptocurrency ecosystem offering a wide range of services.  Coinbase has grown rapidly due to its simple interface and ease of use. Over the years, Coinbase has not only expanded its cryptocurrency portfolio but also added new services including Coinbase Pro for experienced traders, Coinbase Wallet for storing cryptocurrencies and various financial services for corporate clients.  

### **-Funding**

As with many startups funds were scarce at first.  So Armstrong enrolled in the Y Combinator startup incubator program and received a US$150,000 cash infusion.  In May 2013, the company received a US$5 million Series A investment led by Fred Wilson from the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures. In December, the company received a US$25 million investment from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures (USV), and Ribbit Capital. Olaf Carlson-Wee, a graduate from Vassar College, was hired as the first employee in the same year.

In January 2015, the company received a US$75 million investment, led by Draper Fisher Jurvetson, the New York Stock Exchange, USAA, and several banks. Later in January, the company launched a U.S.-based bitcoin exchange for professional traders called Coinbase Exchange. In September, Coinbase began to offer services in Canada and Singapore.

 In April, a U.K. corporate filing stated that Coinbase's non-U.S. revenue grew 20 percent to €153 million (US$173 million) in 2018 resulting in a net profit of €6.6 million. Coinbase U.K. CEO Zeeshan Feroz said the company's non-U.S. operations accounted for nearly one-third of the company's overall revenue and Reuters estimated that the company's global revenue totalled "around $520 million" in 2018.

 In 2021, Coinbase reported revenue from these sources of almost $484.6 million, an increase from just over $136.3 million in 2020.

The company made history in April 2021 by being the first crypto company in the world to go public. Coinbase listed on Nasdaq, and its direct listing opened at $350 per share, $100 above its set reference price. Its valuation reached over $112B at one point during its debut but closed at about $86B.


 ### **-Business Activities**

Like any innovative company, Coinbase faced its own problems and challenges, including security issues, regulatory pressure and the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Despite this, the company has continued to grow, introduce new technologies, and strive to create a more open financial system for people around the world.

In May 2016, the company rebranded the Coinbase Exchange, changing the name to Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX). In July, they added retail support for Ether. Also, in July, they announced they would halt services in August after the closure of Canadian online payments service provider Vogogo.

In January and then March 2017, Coinbase obtained BitLicense and was licensed to trade in Ethereum and Litecoin from the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS). In November, Coinbase was ordered by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to report any users who had at least US$20,000 in transactions in a year. On December 19, Coinbase listed Bitcoin Cash, and the Coinbase platform experienced price abnormalities that led to an insider trading investigation.

In 2014, the company grew to one million users, acquired the blockchain explorer service Blockr and the web bookmarking company Kippt, secured insurance covering the value of bitcoin stored on their servers and launched the vault system for secure bitcoin storage. Throughout 2014, the company also partnered with Overstock, Dell, Expedia, Dish Network, and Time Inc. allowing those firms to accept bitcoin payments. In the same year, the company also added bitcoin payment processing capabilities to the traditional payment companies Stripe, Braintree, and PayPal. In January 2014, Coinbase Global, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware as a holding company for Coinbase and its subsidiaries. The corporate reorganization that saw Coinbase become a subsidiary of Coinbase Global was completed in April of that year.

In 2017, in the wake of the cryptocurrency boom, when the price of bitcoin soared to $19,000, Coinbase became one of the busiest cryptocurrency platforms, serving millions of new users. This period was also marked by a significant increase in trading volume on the platform.

On February 23, 2018, Coinbase told approximately 13,000 affected customers that the company would be providing their taxpayer ID, name, birth date, address, and historical transaction records from 2013 to 2015 to the IRS within 21 days. In March, Coinbase appointed Emilie Choi, a former LinkedIn executive, as Vice President of Corporate and Business Development. She was promoted to the role of president and chief operating officer in May 2019. On March 26, 2018, Coinbase announced their intention to add support for ERC-20 tokens. On April 5, 2018, Coinbase announced that it had formed an early-stage venture fund, Coinbase Ventures, focusing on investment into blockchain- and cryptocurrency-related companies. On May 16, Coinbase Ventures announced its first investment in Compound Labs, a start-up building Ethereum smart contracts similar to money markets. On May 23, GDAX was rebranded as Coinbase Pro. Also in May, Coinbase launched Prime, a platform dedicated to institutional customers. In August, Amazon cloud executive Tim Wagner joined Coinbase as vice president of engineering. In September, Coinbase, along with Circle and Bitcoin miner company Bitmain, was part of a consortium called Centre that launched a digital coin called USD Coin, pegged to the U.S. dollar.

In January 2019, Coinbase stopped all trading on Ethereum Classic due to a suspicion of an attack on the network. In February, Coinbase announced that it had acquired "blockchain intelligence platform" Neutrino, an Italy-based startup, for an undisclosed price. The acquisition raised concern among some Coinbase users based on Neutrino founders' connection to the Hacking Team, which has been accused of providing internet surveillance technology to governments with poor human rights records. On March 4, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said his company "did not properly evaluate" the deal from a due diligence perspective and thus any Neutrino staff who previously worked at Hacking Team "will transition out of Coinbase."

In April 2021, Coinbase became the first major cryptocurrency exchange to go public through a direct listing on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker COIN. This was a significant moment for the entire crypto industry, emphasising its growing legitimacy and acceptance in traditional financial markets.

In August, Coinbase announced that it was targeted by a hacking attack attempt in mid-June. This reported attack used spear-phishing and social engineering tactics (including sending fake e-mails from compromised email accounts and creating a landing page at the University of Cambridge) and two Firefox browser zero-day vulnerabilities. One of the Firefox vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to escalate privileges from JavaScript on a browser page (CVE-2019–11707) and the other, could allow the attacker to escape the browser sandbox and execute code on the host computer (CVE-2019–11708). Coinbase's security team detected and blocked the attack, the network was not compromised, and no cryptocurrency was stolen.

Over the years, Coinbase has not only expanded its cryptocurrency portfolio but also added new services including Coinbase Pro for experienced traders, Coinbase Wallet for storing cryptocurrencies and various financial services for corporate clients.
