-How the idea of Coinbase came about

Coinbase started as a platform for simply buying, selling and storing bitcoins, but over time it has evolved into a multifunctional cryptocurrency ecosystem offering a wide range of services.

**Cryptocurrency** is digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment created using encryption algorithms. This digital money doesn't require a bank or financial institution to verify transactions and can be used for purchases or as an investment. Transactions are then verified and recorded on a blockchain, an unchangeable ledger that tracks and records assets and trades.Cryptocurrency is digital money that doesn't require a bank or financial institution to verify transactions and can be used for purchases or as an investment.
